Assignment 1 for TCSS
I used quicksort for sort 1. It took 24 ms so it was very fast. For the second sort I used bubble sort which
took 160000 ms. Quicksort uses a divide and conquer strategy by choosing a pivot point and then splitting
into larger or smaller than. You continue doing so until you only have 1 element then it is sorted.
Bubble sort works by comparing elements side by side and swapping them if necessary until the array
is sorted. Quicksort is nlogn efficiency while bubble is n^2 efficiency. I got both algorithms from 
rosettacode.org
